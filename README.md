# Car Clicker

This is a simple application built to implement the MVC architecture pattern.

The Car Clicker application is a variant of the well-known app cat clicker. Some significant differences in the Car Clicker app are:

1. No cats, only muscle cars images
2. Multiple car models listed
3. Multiple click counters
4. Only displays the car selected
